Pokemon GS Code Generator 1.1 by Kyrushi
You can contact me on Twitter @Kyrushi_

Please note that because this was done in Python, you need to install Python to run the program (i'm not sure how to make an EXE yet)
It is 100% free online, so if you have interest in my work, you can install that from here: https://www.python.org/

This program does just as it says on the tin. It will generate Gameshark codes for use in the Pokemon Gold and Silver videogames.

This program can generate codes for the following:
- Moves: Simply type in what moves you want.
A few moves that have common abreviations such as twave for Thunder Wave will work.
Because I have to type in each name to check individually, I only included moves with competitive value and OHKO moves. 
As such it is normal that some moves like Growl and Harden will return errors and ask you to try again.

- Max EVs 
Because of how long the code for changing these stats are, and because applying too many codes at once can crash the game, it only shares code for the first party slot.
As such, you will want to move pokemon to the first slot one at a time.

- IVs (aka DVs): It will ask you what hidden power you are looking for, Dark being perfect stats.

- Max Friendship: For those using Return or wanting to evolve certain pokemon

- Max Level
This Includes a rare candy code that replaces the first item slot. This is because the code to set EXP is (unfortunately) not permanent.
If you know of a better code that permanently sets a Pokemon to level 100, please feel free to share it with me!

I am fairly new to programing and wanted to find something simple to work on to help me put the basics to use.
If you're willing to assist me in persuing further, I will appreciate any help you're willing to give me!! DM my Twitter :)
